        <p>EduSnap is an initiative of Aman and Ashish whom main aim is to provide quality education. EduSnap founded in 2020, by Aman Kumar. At first EduSnap was known as a Youtube Channel only where Aman and Ashish  tried to make students employable by teaching them various skills and provide internship platform to apply that skills. It was a project that has changed lives of around 500 students. <br>
            Then they found teaching a passion and became an educational provider starting from 2 students only. But now EduSnap made a great base to touch the heights in the field of Education. <br>
            Our main aim is not only complete the syllabus just to give the exam, rather we teach to make a strong foundation of concepts that will ultimately leads to the success. We focuses not on memorizing concepts but We make things easier so that you grab the concept and understand it effortlessly.
            If you want our thinking the same way, put learnings above than memorizing , then please come and join our community. If making a strong educational foundation is as important as it's for us, then please don't waste a single moment and come with us to make an incredible journey. <br>
